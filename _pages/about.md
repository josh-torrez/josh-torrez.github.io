## Welcome

I'm Joshua Torrez, a Computer Science student at the [University of Houston](https://www.cs.uh.edu/), expected to graduate in May 2027. I'm passionate about interactive computer graphics, game engine development, and low-level graphics programming.

## Education

**University of Houston** - Houston, TX
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Expected: May 2027)

**Lone Star College System** - Houston, TX
Associate of Science in Computer Science (Graduated: December 2024)

## Professional Background

I currently work as a Store Supervisor at Casper, where I manage client relationships using Salesforce CRM and create data-driven sales strategies. Previously, I served as a Sales Lead at Purple, where I improved team conversion rates by 15% year-over-year through targeted coaching and sales strategy development.

## Technical Interests & Projects

My primary focus is on computer graphics and game engine development. I've worked on several projects that demonstrate my passion for this field:

- **Isometric Game Engine**: Developed a 2D isometric rendering engine in Python with OpenGL, featuring procedural dungeon generation, sprite animation systems, and custom shader programs for dynamic lighting and fog of war effects.

- **Vulkan Rendering Engine**: Currently building a cross-platform graphics engine using Vulkan API with support for macOS via MoltenVK, implementing low-level graphics features including validation layers, device management, and queue families.

- **Linear Algebra Calculator**: Built a Python GUI application using Tkinter for solving systems of linear equations through matrix operations.

I'm proficient in C++, Python, and JavaScript, with experience in graphics APIs including Vulkan, OpenGL, and Metal. I also work with game engines like Unreal Engine and development tools including Git, Docker, and various IDEs.
