## Key Features

- **Procedural Dungeon Generation**: Hybrid algorithm for creating randomized dungeon layouts
- **Advanced Animation System**: 8/16-directional character movement with combat states
- **Enemy AI Behaviors**: Intelligent NPC pathfinding and decision-making
- **Custom Shaders**: Dynamic lighting effects, fog of war, and tile-based occlusion rendering

## Technologies

- Python
- OpenGL
- PyGame

## Technical Highlights

The engine features a sophisticated sprite animation system that handles multiple directional movements and state transitions. The custom shader programs enable real-time lighting calculations and visibility occlusion, creating an immersive dungeon exploration experience.
